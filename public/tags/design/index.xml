      <title>Why isn&#39;t there a gb run command ?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;gb is a project based tool. Every subcommand works on a list of import paths (packages) within that project, and most default to &amp;ldquo;all packages in the project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my frustrations with the go tool was its inconsistency in this manner, most go commands work on import paths, except for &lt;code&gt;go run&lt;/code&gt; which takes a file. Actually that&amp;rsquo;s not correct, &lt;code&gt;go run&lt;/code&gt; takes a list of files, but your chances of success of using it drops exponentially the more files you pass to &lt;code&gt;go run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I recognise the utility of &lt;code&gt;go run&lt;/code&gt; for simple examples, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to introduce the language, the fact that it works allowed many new gophers to use it well past the point of its original intent and have a confusing and unsatisfactory time. When they ask for help, they have the double wammy that smug experienced gophers tell them &amp;ldquo;they are holding it wrong&amp;rdquo; and should learn to restructure their code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because gb is focused on a project workflow, not a package or file workflow; most of the time you are building or testing your project (see digression in #49 ) I felt I could make things simpler and more consistent by not supporting &lt;code&gt;gb run&lt;/code&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
